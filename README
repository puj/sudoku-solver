Tests and benchmarks can be done by using the JavaScript console.
Use the command: 
sudoku.test.runTest(Object) where Object is {SQUARE: digit}

or you can use one of the predeclared tests: 
sudoku.test.runTest(sudoku.test.grids.easy.svd_1)

You can also test an entire predeclared group by using:
sudoku.test.runGroupTest(label) where label is one of the labels in sudoku.test.grids
"sm" for example.
